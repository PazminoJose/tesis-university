  abstract = {Law Enforcement agencies are faced with a problem of effectively predicting the likelihood of crime happening given the past crime data which would otherwise help them to do so. There is a need to identify the most efficient algorithm that can be used in crime prediction given the past crime data. In this research, Business intelligence techniques considered was based on supervised learning (Classification) techniques given that labeled training data was available. Four different classification algorithms that is; decision tree (J48), Na{\"i}ve Bayes, Multilayer Perceptron and Support Vector Machine were compared to find the most effective algorithm for crime prediction. The study used classification models generated using Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA). Manual method of attribute selection was used; this is because it works well when there is large number of attributes. The dataset was acquired from UCI machine learning repository website with a title `Crime and Communities'. The data set had 128 attributes of which 13 were selected for the study. The study revealed that the accuracy of J48, Na{\"i}ve bayes, Multilayer perceptron and Support Vector Machine (SMO) is approximately 100\%, 89.7989\%, 100\% and 92.6724\%, respectively for both training and test data. Also the execution time in seconds of J48, Na{\"i}ve bayes, Multilayer perceptron and SVO is 0.06, 0.14, 9.26 and 0.66 respectively using windows7 32 bit. Hence, Decision Tree (J48) out performed Na{\"i}ve bayes, Multilayer perceptron and Support Vector Machine (SMO) algorithms, and manifested higher performance both in execution time and in accuracy. The scope of this project was to identify the most effective and accurate Business intelligence technique that can be used during crime data mining to provide accurate results.},

  abstract = {In the era of social networks, internet of things and location-based services, many online services produce a huge amount of data that have valuable objective information, such as geographic coordinates and date time. These characteristics (parameters) in the combination with a textual parameter bring the challenge for the discovery of geospatiotemporal knowledge. This challenge requires efficient methods for clustering and pattern mining in spatial, temporal and textual spaces. In this thesis, we address the challenge of providing methods and frameworks for geospatiotemporal data analytics. As an initial step, we address the challenges of geospatial data processing: data gathering, normalization, geolocation, and storage. That initial step is the basement to tackle the next challenge {\textendash} geospatial clustering challenge. The first step of this challenge is to design the method for online clustering of georeferenced data. This algorithm can be used as a serverside clustering algorithm for online maps that visualize massive georeferenced data. As the second step, we develop the extension of this method that considers, additionally, the temporal aspect of data. For that, we propose the density and intensity-based geospatiotemporal clustering algorithm with fixed distance and time radius. Each version of the clustering algorithm has its own use case that we show in the thesis. In the next chapter of the thesis, we look at the spatiotemporal analytics from the perspective of the sequential rule mining challenge. We design and implement the framework that transfers data into textual geospatiotemporal data - data that contain geographic coordinates, time and textual parameters. By this way, we address the challenge of applying pattern/rule mining algorithms in geospatiotemporal space. As the applicable use case study, we propose spatiotemporal crime analytics {\textendash} discovery spatiotemporal patterns of crimes in publicly available crime data. The second part of the thesis, we dedicate to the application part and use case studies. We design and implement the application that uses the proposed clustering algorithms to discover knowledge in data. Jointly with the application, we propose the use case studies for analysis of georeferenced data in terms of situational and public safety awareness.},

Just like vaccination is given to a child to prevent disease, in today's world with such higher crime rate and brutal crime happenings, it have become necessary to have a vaccination systems that prevents from crimes happening. By vaccinating society against crime it refers to various methods such as educating peoples, creating awareness, increasing efficiency and proactive policing methods and other deterrent techniques. Inspired by two different existing approach to crime prediction, the first one present a visual analytics approach that provides decision makers with a proactive and predictive environment in order to assist them in making effective resource allocation and deployment decisions. Crime incident prediction has depends mainly on the historical crime record and various geospatial and demographic information [1]. Even though it's promising, they do not take into account the rich and rapidly expanding social \& web media context that surrounds incidents of interest. Next approach is based on the semantic analysis and natural language processing of Twitter posts via latent Dirichlet allocation, Topic detection \& Sentiment analysis[3[4]]. But both the techniques faces inherent limitations. Crime that happens these days are have following key characteristics such as crimes repeating in a periodic fashion, crimes occurring as a result of some other activity and occurrence of crimes pre indicated by some other information.},

We described the nature of the studied proximity strategy and evaluated it before-after through exhaustive control groups. For so, we measured correlations between crimes decreasing and Euclidean radius around Communitarian police headquarters during the period when policies were implemented. We found that police proximity and related strategies are visibly associated with crime decreasing, but other con\- texts could also be involved.

  abstract = {This research project focuses on the development of a mobile application that helps to address a problem of social context, such as citizen insecurity, which affects several areas or neighborhoods of the Parish of Sta. Rosa in the city of Ambato. Citizens are the most affected because it is difficult for them to carry out their daily activities normally since they, their relatives or their material goods are always in danger. Currently, many solutions are being given to different problems through the implementation of systems or apps. A clear example is the rise of applications for mobile devices that are within reach of many users simplifying their tasks and resources such as time and money. In this sense, it is opportune to implement a mobile application type panic button like the one used by the police, focused mainly on the neighbors of the neighborhoods so that they can alert among the neighborhood community any situation of risk or emergency. The purpose of this project is to support the neighborhoods of The Parish of St. Rose so that they can be prepared and prevented from the increase in crime. Therefore, these must be organized, collaborative and participatory, so that they can provide help to the citizen in danger and thus give a warning message to criminals. During the analysis and development of the technologies for the implementation of the application, comparisons were made with the aim of determining the free and free tools that help obtain quality software and avoid incurring expenses for those who will use the application. The most important tools that were used during the development were Ionic and Angular for the Frontend, Node.js and MongoDB for the Backend, the agile Mobile-D development methodology was also used since it easily adapts to this type of projects that do not require many modules or a lot of time for their implementation.},

Companies that provide internet service aren't exception due to the large amount of processes and information management involved, so they require the use of computer systems that help to better carry out their activities in order to offer a better quality of service to their customers. The objective of this research project is the implementation of a web application in the company Optynet in the canton of Quero, due to the fact that currently they have a manual control of the information, in addition the time spent to locate the clients homes is high, in the same way there is a low communication with them. Therefore, through the use of technological tools we seek to cover these requirements, adding functions to the application to help manage activities such as: customer registration, installations, technical support, suppliers, geolocation on maps with time and distance estimation, as well as sending payment notifications via WhatsApp, in order to offer a better service experience to customers. The web application was developed with ASP.NET Core and Angular technologies, allowing to have separate back-end and front-end, facilitating the maintenance and scalability of the web application; the use of libraries such as: AutoMapper, RestSharp and those comprising Microsoft.EntityFramework server-side and client-side libraries such as: Angular Material and MapBoxalong with the MySQL database engine favored the development process of the web application. In addition, the methodology used for the development of the application was Extreme Programming (XP) for its efficiency, flexibility and control in the fulfilment of processes through a good management of activities.},

When modeling crime data, assumptions on either the spatial or the temporal relationship between observations are necessary if any statistical analysis is to be performed. In this paper, we structure space{\textendash}time dependency for count data by considering a stochastic difference equation for the intensity of the space{\textendash}time process rather than placing structure on a latent space{\textendash}time process, as Cox processes would do. We introduce a class of spatially correlated self-exciting spatio-temporal models for count data that capture both dependence due to self-excitation, as well as dependence in an underlying spatial process. We follow the principles in Clark and Dixon (2021) but considering a generalized additive structure on spatio-temporal varying covariates. A Bayesian framework is proposed for inference of model parameters. We analyze three distinct crime datasets in the city of Riobamba (Ecuador). Our model fits the data well and provides better predictions than other alternatives.},

There have been, however, only limited efforts in doing so, possibly due to a lack of effective methods for estimating, identifying the difference in the levels of spatial clustering patterns, and visualizing the spatiotemporal trends among the events. We first describe a method for examining the periodicity of space{\textendash}time crime events. Two indexes are extended from the Moran's index for spatial autocorrelation and local indicator of spatial association (LISA) to ones for including spatiotemporal event-region data. We also suggest a three-dimensional approach to visualizing spatiotemporal associations among event regions that enables a better understanding of the spatial processes behind the evolution of event regions. An implementation of the suggested methods that use data of three types of crime events in Akron, Ohio, is reported. The suggested approach is capable of summarizing spatiotemporal autocorrelation as well as identifying spatiotemporal clusters of crime events. Compared to layered LISA, this approach works well, and it allows three-dimensional visualizations of spatiotemporal clusters of events that can help to develop effective policing strategies for combating crimes.},

Data driven researches are useful to prevent and solve crime. Recent research shows that 50\% of the crimes are committed by only handful of offenders. The law enforcement officers need early information about the criminal activity to response and solve the spatio-temporal criminal activity. In this research, supervised learning algorithms are used to predict criminal activity. The proposed data driven system predicts crimes by analyzing San Francisco city criminal activity data set for 12 years. Decision tree and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithms are applied to predict crime. But these two algorithms provide low accuracy in prediction. Then, random forest is applied as an ensemble methods and adaboost is used as a boosting method to increase the accuracy of prediction. However, log-loss is used to measure the performance of classifiers by penalizing false classifications. As the dataset contains highly class imbalance problems, a random undersampling method for random forest algorithm gives the best accuracy. The final accuracy is 99.16\% with 0.17\% log loss.},

Specifically, the potential use of ambient population as a crime rate denominator and predictor for predictive policing models is evaluated, using mobile phone data (with a total of 9,397,473 data points) as a proxy. The results show that ambient population correlates more strongly with crime than residential population. Crime rates based on ambient population designate different problem areas than crime rates based on residential population. The prediction performance of predictive policing models can be improved by using ambient population instead of residential population. These findings support that ambient population is a more suitable population-at-risk measure, as it better reflects the underlying dynamics in spatiotemporal crime trends. Its use has therefore much as-of-yet unused potential not only for criminal research and theory testing, but also for intelligence-led policy and practice.},

  abstract = {Forecasting crime is complex since several complicated aspects contribute to a crime. Predicting crime becomes more challenging because of the enormous number of everyday crime episodes in varied places. Though there are many established machine learning and deep learning techniques, law enforcement officers face challenges in preventing crime from occurring promptly. An efficient way of law enforcement is required to lower the crime rates. This paper proposed an effective multi-module method for predicting crime using deep learning techniques. Our proposed method has two modules: Feature Level Fusion and Decision Level Fusion. The first module employs temporal-based Attention LSTM, Spatio-Temporal based Stacked Bidirectional LSTM, and Fusion model. The Fusion model leverages the prior two models' training data. The temporal-based model is the source model for the transfer learning technique on the dataset of different cities. By applying this technique, the training time of the model is reduced. In the second module, the Spatio-Temporal based Attention-LSTM, Stacked Bidirectional LSTM, and the result of feature-level fusion module are used to get the final prediction. The proposed architecture predicts the next hour based on the data from the past twenty-four hours. The estimated number of crimes in any category for a particular location can be obtained as the output of our suggested model. It also enables law enforcement to get insight into future crime occurrences based on category, time, and location. This work concentrated mainly on the USA's San Francisco and Chicago cities for the experimental analysis. For the San Francisco and Chicago datasets, our model has the Mean Absolute Error of 0.008, 0.02, the Coefficient of Determination of 0.95 and 0.94, and the Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 1.03\% and 0.6\%, respectively. The proposed model outperforms numerous other well-known models.},

In previous work, crime prediction has been performed by identifying hotspots from data, which means areas of high criminal activity on the streets. By focusing efforts on such sites, police patrolling is expected to be more efficient, thus reducing criminal activity. However, not many studies focus on investigating how police patrolling affects crime, and whether it can be a predictor of crime activity. In this paper we discuss the main challenges of this problem, and describe some work in progress towards developing a robust methodology to represent, visually analyze, and build predictors for criminal activity, considering both criminal and police patrolling spatiotemporal data. As a case study, we use real datasets from the Military Police of the state of Alagoas, Brazil (PM-AL).},

Based on the detected criminal patterns, we further propose a Crime Rate Evaluation (CRE) algorithm to identify the crime rate for each group of locations and target types. In addition, we propose a Criminal Hotspot Locating (CHL) algorithm to predict and highlight the hotspot areas for the prevention of the target place. Moreover, to improve the performance of the proposed CPD system that mainly contains CAC, CRE, and CHL algorithms, we implement a parallel solution for these algorithms using high-performance computing power. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms can effectively detect accurate criminal patterns from large-scale spatiotemporal data.},
